  This page outlines the sample legal terms and conditions ("<strong>Terms & Conditions</strong>") under which <strong>SwiftTag Mobility Pvt. Ltd.</strong> issues and manages electronic toll payment tags ("<strong>FASTag</strong>") for vehicles registered in India. These tags enable automatic toll deduction via RFID technology across national highways and select state roads. By using our FASTag services through our website, mobile app, or authorized agents (collectively referred to as "<strong>Platform</strong>"), you agree to comply with these Terms. We simulate adherence to guidelines issued by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and reserve the right to update these terms for demo purposes. For mock support inquiries, please contact our fictional helpdesk.
